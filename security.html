    <h2>Security, cracnked up to eleven!</h2>
    <p> Security is not just about encryption. Or authentication. 
        We think architecture, code quality, quality of the components 
        we use to build our software and the places we get our components. 
        With 20 years of experience we believe in minimalism. Less code, less errors, less vulnerabilities. </p>

   <h2>Respecting Privacy</h2>

    <p>Security and privacy go hand-in-hand. We store only what is absolutely
      necessary to serve you. Thanks to end-to-end encryption that is not much -
      only you have the keys to decrypt your information.

    <h2>Designed to Survive</h2>

    <p>Simple survives. Our products are simple, yet versatile.
       They stand alone, yet you can manage them. We challenged few of the basic assumptions to avoid
       complexity. At the time of trouble, you will appreciate you have something to rely on.
