# Teaser Campaign

Howdy stranger! Congratulations! You've found our secret we so
rigorously guarded! What ever you do - DON'T TELL ANYONE!
Like... don't share this in Twitter. #sensorfuleaks

Here we plan the teaser campaign. Planned campaign principles first:

* Drop information in digestible sizes.
* Reflect ongoing activity in the web page

## Round 001 - Break out

*Have you seen a jail which focuses on preventing break-ins?*

* An animation of a man breaking out from the box.
  * Original <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efexDg5q7Dw>

## Round 002 - Red

* Introduce the Red theme by switching the top-border and animation color.
